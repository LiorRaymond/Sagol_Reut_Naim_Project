Next Steps: 
1. Finish cleaning data and create data dictionary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Boxplots for clinical and task variables. 
3. Inferential Tests: Two independent samples t-tests (two-tailed) to explore whether healthy volunteers vs. DMDD/sub-DMDD/ADHD (binary dependent variable) differ on anxiety (SCARED Total Score, IV) and irritability (ARI Total Score, IV) - separately for each IV. 
4. Select features (machine learning term for variables) to include in the model.

Extra (if you have time): 
1. Zero-order correlations (not controlling for other variables - e.g., Pearson's) between all variables.

Next Steps: 
1. Add labeled outliers (with participant ID) for boxplots and share with R. Naim.
2. Get histogram for age variable. 
3. Zero-order correlations (not controlling for other variables - e.g., Pearson's): 
      - Between features
      - Between features and ARI (parent)
      - Between features and SCARED (parent)
   Note: Before running correlations, z-score all variables. Also, apply False Discovery Rate (FDR) to p-value threshold of 0.10.
4. Z. Laky to review eye tracking data for two flagged participants: 23149, 24234.

1. List of features significantly correlated, along with associated r values
2. Re-run zero-order correlations (with null for 23149, 24234): 
      - Between features
      - Between features and ARI (parent, total)
      - Between features and SCARED (parent, total)
      - Between ARI and SCARED (parent, item-level and total)
3. R. Naim and Z. Laky to consider whether model should account for dependancies between ARI and SCARED.
