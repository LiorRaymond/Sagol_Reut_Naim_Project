Next Steps: 
1. Finish cleaning data and create data dictionary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Boxplots for clinical and task variables. 
3. Inferential Tests: Two independent samples t-tests (two-tailed) to explore whether healthy volunteers vs. DMDD/sub-DMDD/ADHD (binary dependent variable) differ on anxiety (SCARED Total Score, IV) and irritability (ARI Total Score, IV) - separately for each IV. 
4. Select features (machine learning term for variables) to include in the model.

Extra (if you have time): 
1. Zero-order correlations (not controlling for other variables - e.g., Pearson's) between all variables.
